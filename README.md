## Where is the Source Code?

You might be here looking for the source code. Unfortunately, due to repeated instances of this project being stolen and misrepresented in a broken, incomplete state, I've decided to keep the code for this version private for now.

I am considering releasing an official, cleaned-up open-source version in the future. Please be patient and wait for that instead of using unauthorized copies, which reflect poorly on my work and are not representative of the final product.

## Project Overview

MitchIvin XP is an interactive web-based simulation of the Windows XP desktop environment, created by Mitch Ivin for portfolio and demonstration purposes.

## Disclaimer Regarding Assets

This project is a work of parody and is intended for educational and demonstrative purposes only. It is a technical re-creation of a classic operating system interface for the web.

All graphical assets, icons, sounds, and any other trademarked materials related to the Windows XP operating system are the property of **Microsoft Corporation**. This project does not claim any ownership of these assets. Their use in the live project is for the purpose of commentary and parody.
